# Notes on *Anopheles farauti*

## 1. Habitat type and salinity

*An. farauti s.s.* (farauti 1) is strongly coastal and breeds in brackish water, while *An. farauti* 2 and 3 are more inland and freshwater associated (Sweeney, 1990; van den Hurk, 2000).

Salinity tolerance is key: *An. farauti s.s.* thrives in brackish water near the sea, but *An. farauti* 2 and 3 avoid high salinity (Sweeney, 1990).

## 2.  Elevation and proximity to coast

*An. farauti s.s.* is mostly limited to within \~5 km of the coast. Elevation was found to be a major determinant of its range; models that excluded elevation wrongly predicted inland distributions (Sweeney, 2006).

## 3.  Climate: temperature, rainfall, and humidity

Temperature & rainfall strongly influence seasonal abundance (van den Hurk, 2000).

*An. farauti s.s.* peaks in the wet season (Jan–Apr) (van den Hurk, 2000).

*An. farauti* 2 peaks either in the wet season (lowland swamps) or in late dry/early wet season in highland habitats (van den Hurk, 2000).

*An. farauti* 3 is more abundant in cooler weather, showing a negative correlation with temperature (van den Hurk, 2000).

Humidity also influences biting activity: recent work shows biting increases with higher humidity, though the effect is complex (Chow, 2023).

## 4.  Seasonal patterns

Abundance is highly seasonal, with wet season flooding creating breeding habitats and dry season contraction. *An. farauti* populations show location-specific seasonal peaks tied to rainfall and hydrology (van den Hurk, 2000; Chow, 2023).

## 5.  Vegetation and land use

Habitat surveys highlight associations with Melaleuca swamps, rainforest margins, mangroves, and open swamps (van den Hurk, 1997).

Land use (e.g. agriculture, deforestation) alters mosquito community composition and can shift farauti presence (Steiger, 2016).

## 6.  Host availability and feeding behaviour

Farauti in Queensland are anthropophilic but also opportunistic. Host availability (humans, pigs, dogs) is a key variable affecting blood-feeding success (Russell, 2016).

Host preference is plastic, but humans are slightly favoured when available (Russell, 2016).

## 7.  Behavioural rhythms and circadian control

Flight and biting activity are tied to circadian rhythms, peaking around 19:00–20:00 in Queensland populations naive to control interventions (Chow, 2023a; 2023b).

Night-time biting decreases as temperatures drop through the night (Chow, 2023b).

## Summary for Queensland

The most important variables for *An. farauti* distributions and abundance in Queensland are:

- Proximity to coast & elevation (limiting distribution of *An. farauti s.s.*) (Sweeney, 1990; Sweeney, 2006).
- Salinity and water type (defining larval habitats) (Sweeney, 1990; van den Hurk, 2000).
- Temperature, rainfall, and humidity (driving seasonal and nightly abundance) (van den Hurk, 2000; Chow, 2023b).
- Vegetation/land use (affecting larval habitats and adult resting sites) (van den Hurk, 1997; Steiger, 2016).
- Host availability & biting rhythms (shaping human–vector contact) (Russell, 2016, Chow,2023a; 2023b).

## Other potential variables to explore

Among Topographic and Hydrological Variables: 
- Elevation: Directly influences temperature and can define the upper and lower limits of a species' range. We are already incorporating this one.
- Slope and Aspect: Affects microclimates, sunlight exposure, and water runoff. Should we?
- Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) / Compound Topographic Index (CTI): A measure of where water is likely to accumulate in the landscape, indicating potential larval habitats. Where can we find this?
- Distance to Water Bodies: Proximity to rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands is a strong predictor for many mosquito species.

Among Human-Related (Anthropogenic) Variables: 
- Human Population Density: A direct proxy for the availability of human hosts and the degree of urbanization. Not so important for this species.
- Urbanization/Impervious Surface Area: Measures the extent of built-up areas, which create unique microclimates and artificial breeding sites (e.g., containers, drains). 
- Distance to Roads: Roads can act as corridors for the dispersal of mosquitoes and humans.
- Nighttime Lights: Often used as a proxy for economic development and human activity.
- Livestock Density: Important for zoophilic (animal-biting) mosquito species.
